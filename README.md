# Case period with Noroff : Lagalt

## Goal
**This project is created as a solution to the case "Lagalt". Task given by Noroff University College, Full-Stack Java Development course.**

The goal of the project is to give people a platform where they can cooperate on different projects. Any user can create a project of their interest, and then have other users apply to join the project. 

Projects can vary with a variety of different industries from making music, movies, game development and web development. Each industry also has a preset of skills and keywords that are unique to each industry, that allows project creators to tailor their project towards a specific audience.

Users of the website have two different ways of interacting with the site. **Anonymous mode** allows a user to browse all published projects without having to register an account or login. **Logged in mode** allows all functionality of anonymous mode, but also allows the user to customize their profile with different skills, portfolio and description. In addition the user can apply to join different projects.
